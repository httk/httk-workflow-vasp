"""Supervised VASP execution and its classified run report.

This is the execution side of the dependency-free VASP interface: a live monitor
that turns VASP-5/6 output lines into diagnostics, :func:`run_vasp` which drives
one supervised process and combines the live and file-level diagnostics into a
classified :class:`VaspRunReport`. Historical authorship is documented in
``v1_runtime/NOTICE``.
